# BuckPSU
Arduino library for cheap-as-chips DC-DC converters

See [example here](https://github.com/bengineer19/BuckPSU/blob/master/examples/BuckPSU_example/BuckPSU_example.ino).
This isn't guaranteed to work with all models, this is just what I found works and thought I'd share it in case it's helpful to anyone else.

## Compatible converters
DC-DC converters sold under the brand names Yeeco and DROK seem to be compatible with these commands.
Such as:
* DKP6012 
* DKP6008
